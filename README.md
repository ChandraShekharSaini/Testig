This is DSA Respository
Data structure and algorithm (DSA) are two critical concepts in computer science and software development. Data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently.


DSA is very easy brpo is defined as a combination of two separate yet interrelated topics â€“ Data Structure and Algorithms. DSA is one of the most important skills that every computer science student must have. It is often seen that people with good knowledge of these technologies are better programmers than others and thus, crack the interviews of almost every tech giant like Amazon,google.
